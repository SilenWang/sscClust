This repository was **forked from [Japrin/sscClust](https://github.com/Japrin/sscClust)**. `sscClust` is a convenient pipeline integrated with mutiple methods to cluster cell expression data. I made this copy to fix some small bugs and to make it more convenient for peronal use.

# TODO LIST

- [x] Installation dependency fix(for pkgs from bioconductor)
- [ ] t-SNE plot generated by sscClust was printed to standard output, instead of return a ggplot object, so can't make further modification.
- [ ] Density cluster cut off can only be specified using `parfile`, which can only be an R file, add a arg to specify directly in script
- [x] Argument `ncore` in `ssc.run` does not control differential expression analysis(`do.DE`)
- [x] `do.DE` did not generate DE files.
- [x] All 'geneSymbol' in DE result were fill by gid.
