This repository was **forked from [Japrin/sscClust](https://github.com/Japrin/sscClust)**. `sscClust` is a convenient pipeline integrated with mutiple methods to cluster cell expression data. I made this copy to fix some small bugs and to make it more convenient for peronal use.

# TODO LIST

- [] Installation dependency fix(for pkgs from bioconductor)
- [x] Argument `ncore` in `ssc.run` does not control differential expression analysis(`do.DE`)
- [] t-SNE plot generated by sscClust was printed to standard output, instead of return a ggplot object, so can't make further modification.

# UPDATE

## 2018.09.17 First commit
- Fix Argument `ncore` in `ssc.run` does not control differential expression analysis(`do.DE`)
- Updated readme for this fork
